## ₊⊹ Reminder

Hello ˙ᵕ˙ This is one of my final requirements in Univ and is published to personally showcase my work. 
Please do not re-upload or copy this code for educational assignments without my knowledge (·•᷄ࡇ•᷅ ). Thank you!


## ₊⊹ Note

The project was built in a limited time and while I was still learning ( ˵ •̀ ᴗ •́˵). <br>
Things are a little bit messy here and there--files are also in their not-so-organized places, hehe.
